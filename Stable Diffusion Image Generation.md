# Stable Diffusion Image Generation with Hugging Face ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¨
This repository demonstrates how to generate high-quality AI images using Stable Diffusion v1-4 from Hugging Face's Diffusers library. The script runs on a GPU using PyTorch and creates a stunning AI-generated image based on a text prompt.

## ðŸš€ Features
Utilizes Stable Diffusion v1-4 for text-to-image generation
Runs efficiently on CUDA-enabled GPUs for faster processing
Generates high-resolution AI-generated images
Saves output as a high-quality JPEG file

## ðŸ›  Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate
pip install matplotlib

## ðŸ–¼ Usage
Run the script to generate an image from a text prompt:
python generate_image.py

## ðŸ“· Example Output
Prompt: "A beautiful sunset over the mountain with river and animal"



# ðŸ¤– How It Works
Loads Stable Diffusion v1-4 from Hugging Face's Diffusers library
Moves the model to a CUDA device for efficient inference
Generates a high-resolution image based on the given text prompt
Displays and saves the output image
